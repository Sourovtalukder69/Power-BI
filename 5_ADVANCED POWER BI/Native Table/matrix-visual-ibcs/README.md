### Bug: some charts are broken (e.g. missisng red/green bars, but text labels are visible)

If in you Language and Region settings decimal separator is a comma (e.g. European countries) and not a dot (e.g. the United States), update DAX measures to ensure only whole numbers (makes sense for pixels, but it makes sense to keep one decimal digit for % values) or only numbers with a dot decimal separator are being included into SVG code.

You can add <locale_name> parameter to ensure FORMAT function always uses the US format, e.g. FORMAT ( _WidthValue, "0.0%", "en-US" )
