## Calcualtion items that generate IBCS-styled charts

The most recent versions (there was a lot of tweaking) of the calculation group items designed to generate IBCS-styled charts for Table/Matrix Power BI core visuals.

If you have access to Power BI and Fabric Summit 2024 materials but have not watched my session yet, then watch the "Unleash the full power of built-in Power BI visuals" session (Day 5, Room 7).

See IBCS SVG 3-Tier Chart (with a calculation group).pbix example in the session materials. SVG Absolute Values, SVG Absolute Variance, SVG Relative Variance calculation items in the IBCS CHARTS calculation group of the example report contain older version of the code provided here.

If you want to use the most recent version of the calculation items, you'll need to replace SVG Absolute Values, SVG Absolute Variance, and SVG Relative Variance calculation items in the IBCS CHARTS calculation group with the content of the .dax files. You will also need to create any missing calculation items or measures referenced from the SVG* calculation items. I provide the materials as is, and it's up to you to make them work, but feel free to ask questions.

An updated version of the .pbix example that already includes the most recent version of the code will be published in the future.
